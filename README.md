# Credit Microservices
A Spring Boot based microservices application deployed on AWS cloud, containerized and orchestrated with Docker &amp; Kubernetes. Designed to model the appropriate deconstruction of a banking credit/loan accounting monolith.

**Microservices architecture** breaks apps down into their smallest components, independent from eachother.
